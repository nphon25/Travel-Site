                Dedicated to the goddess Athena, it was completed in the 5th century BCE during the height of the Athenian Empire.
                 Built entirely of marble, the temple is renowned for its harmonious proportions, Doric columns, and sculptural details,
                  including the famous Parthenon frieze. Originally serving as a temple and later as a church and mosque,

            <p>The Ancient Agora of Athens was the political, commercial, and social heart of the city during classical antiquity.
                 Located northwest of the Acropolis, it served as a central gathering place where citizens met for markets, public speeches,
                  and civic decision-making. The site features important structures such as the well-preserved Temple of Hephaestus and the reconstructed
                   Stoa of Attalos, which now houses the Agora Museum. As a hub of daily life and democratic activity in ancient Athens,
                 the Agora offers valuable insights into the civic and cultural foundations of Western society.</p>
